/**
 * Provides a LaunchDarkly team member resource.
 *
 * This resource allows you to create and manage team members within your LaunchDarkly organization.
 *
 * > **Note:** You can only manage team members with "admin" level personal access tokens. To learn more, read [Managing Teams](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/teams).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as launchdarkly from "@pulumi/launchdarkly";
 *
 * const example = new launchdarkly.TeamMember("example", {
 *     email: "example.user@example.com",
 *     firstName: "John",
 *     lastName: "Smith",
 *     role: "writer",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * LaunchDarkly team members can be imported using the team member's 24 character ID, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import launchdarkly:index/teamMember:TeamMember example 5f05565b48be0b441fb63020
 * ```
